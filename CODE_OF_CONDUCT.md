You will not find much here. We intentionally decided to not establish any elaborated `Code of Conduct` for our projects. All project goals are usually clear and contribution rules often enforce proper flow and structure of contribution unit. Most of the other aspects usually covered by `Code of Conduct` are in our opinion invasive and very biased (which is of course totally fine as every project owner is biased but this is also our way to avoid over-enforcing it).
